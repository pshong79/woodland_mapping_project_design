# woodland mapping project design

This project came to be when my daughter was attending a local forest school during her nursery through kindergarten years. 

At the time, one of the administrators approached me about the possibility of building a website to assist other educators and families should they decide to take their students / children outdoors into parks and wild spaces. 

The idea was that this would be some sort of a knowledge repository for activities and articles for specific spaces in various parks around the area. 

I started to build this rough, and unfinished, design of the possible site so this administrator could take it and start pitching the idea to see if she could get someone, or some organization, to help fund this build.

Since then, certain circumstances and events have taken place and this project was placed on hold, and eventually just dropped. Additionally, I had saved this in hopes that it may eventually be picked up again at some point. 

Recently, I found this and decided to put it up on Github so it does not get lost and, maybe, just to develop my own skillset, pick this back up and complete the design. 

## Technologies

This wireframe was built using Bootstrap. I am aware that there is a _TON_ of work that needs to be done refactor. 

If I ever find the time, or if I become interested in this again, I may take the time to do so; however, for now, I am just going to leave this as is.


### To view

To view this project, one just needs to download the zip file, unzip it, and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.


### Other things to note

I have removed all icons, logos, and text that may allow for the identification of the administrator or the school this project originated from.
